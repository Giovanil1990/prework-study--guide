Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? To make the bootcamp as easy as possible if I need to go back and look at my notes.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") To write down notes.
- What problem does it solve? Any questions I may have about any of the topics we discussed, without having to ask instructors first.
- What did you learn? I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
